##Orignal Spec
Details: Stanley and I have been doing ACM training for the last semester and one thing I have always found interesting is how do they get problems, and converesly, how do people discover good problems to solve that might interest them and improve their skills? Proposal, a reddit style coding challenge site where people post problems and solutions. Additionally, the whole thing will be decentralised so the actual auto marking is conducted across the network on any client that is connected. Problems could rotate, also there could be a way to improve answers so people only need come up with the problems in the first place and then the answers can be generated by the community, then verified then added to the accepted solutions. Problems could have tags which allow users to discover them more easily; for example, graphs, c++ or beginner

##Updated Spec:

dvJudge is a Distributed Virtual Judge. Essentially it takes the role of many of the current virtual judges that exist and but instead of having a centralised server which distributes problems, and solutions, it will take a distributed network approach to supply problems and solutions.

##Key features:
1. Distributed solution checking
2. Community based content generation/validation


##Potential Future Additions:
1. Content discovery based on community rating
2. "Playlists" and Competition hosting
